<title>Overview</title>
<p>There are currently <b>quickstart</b> scripts that seek to automate
the deployment to popular Kube environments:
 * quickstart-for-gke.sh
 * quickstart-for-ocp.sh</p>
<p>The <b>quickstart-for-gke</b> script will deploy the operator to
a GKE Kube cluster.</p>
<p>The <b>quickstart-for-ocp</b> script will deploy the operator to
an Openshift Container Platform cluster.</p>
<p>Both scripts assume you have a StorageClass defined for persistence.</p>
<p>Pre-compiled versions of the Operator <b>pgo</b> client are provided for the x86_64, Mac OSX, and Windows hosts.</p>

<p>The <b>quickstart-for-gke.sh</b> script will allow users to set up the Postgres Operator quickly on GKE including PKS.
This script is tested on GKE but can be modified for use with other Kubernetes environments as well.</p>
<p>The script requires a few things in order to work:</p>
<list>
<list-item>
wget utility installed
</list-item>
<list-item>
kubectl utility installed
</list-item>
<list-item>
StorageClass defined
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Executing the script will give you a default Operator deployment
that assumes <b>dynamic</b> storage and a storage class named <b>standard</b>,
things that GKE provides.</p>
<p>The script performs the following:</p>
<list>
<list-item>
downloads the Operator configuration files
</list-item>
<list-item>
sets the $HOME/.pgouser file to default settings
</list-item>
<list-item>
deploys the Operator Deployment
</list-item>
<list-item>
sets your .bashrc to include the Operator environment variables
</list-item>
<list-item>
sets your $HOME/.bash_completion file to be the <b>pgo</b> bash_completion file
</list-item>
</list>

<p>A similar script for installing the operator on OCP is
offered with similar features as the GKE script.  This script is
tested on OCP 3.7 with a StorageClass defined.</p>
